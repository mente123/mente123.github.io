# mente123.github.io(My Personal Portfolio).
This is a personal portfolio Assignment for our web progrmming course and I am learning Web Development from Scratch and now I have skills in front End like html, css and js.
In addition to this Iam exploring in a Back end to get skills in php and my sql and from the courses i enrolled and finished I have set of skills php and conneting it with databases.
I used html, css, javascript and fontawesome to build this portfolio and I used github and/or w3 school to host it. Actually I preffered w3 school because they have a free domain with 
a 5000 requests, 100mb storage and it is fast enough to load the documents upladed.
I really appreciate if you can reach me and see my work and I am an open-minded guy who is ready to accept comments for better improvement.
